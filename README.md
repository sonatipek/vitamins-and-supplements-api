# Vitamins and Supplements API
Vitamins and Supplements API is a RESTful service created to provide access to basic information and recommendations about vitamins and dietary supplements. The API fetches vitamin/supplement information such as dosage, benefits, recommendations and score through various endpoints. It can create, update and delete supplements/vitamins.

I used this API in my "vitamins&supplements" infographic frontend project to support athletes' training programs, help sedentary individuals find the right supplements for them, and provide information to anyone who wants to make informed decisions about nutrition.

_Does not contain recommendations for use, I recommend that you consult your doctor in any case_
